## TorqueMeasurement

# Overview
Specializing in the testing and measurement of electric motors, it is crucial to analyze measurement data after each test. This Torque Measurement Analysis and Visualization Tool is designed to meet the specific needs of characterizing electric motors based on defined criteria set by the test engineer. The goal is to ensure consistent characterization of every product measured using a common reference tool.

# Requirement
**Phase 1:** **Torque Analysis Tool**

I. Objective:
Develop a measurement tool to analyze and calculate various parameters of the measurement data, including Maximum, Minimum, Average, errors, and interesting regions/bands.

II. User Story:
As a test manager, should be able to define the parameters for analysis to meet the specific requirements of torque measurement analysis.

**Phase 2:** **Torque Comparison Tool**

I. Objective:
Provide an option/feature to compare the results of several measurements and their calculated parameters.

II. User Story:
As a test engineer, I need the ability to compare torque measurement results to identify patterns, trends, and variations between different measurements.

**Phase 3:** **Web Application Development**

I. Objective:
Develop a web application that integrates the analysis and comparison tools, along with additional features for efficient data flow and management.

II. Features:
Data Flow Management:
Implement a system to handle regular measurement data efficiently.

Tool Upgrades:
Provide the capability to upgrade the tool based on the evolving needs of test engineers.

User-Friendly Interface:
Develop an intuitive web interface for ease of use by test engineers.
