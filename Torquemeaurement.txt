Torque measurement analysis and visualization tool:

As a test engineer I perform the testing and measurement of electric motors. The measurement data needs to be analysed after the test.
There are several criterias set to charaterize the electric motors tested.

To characterise the product, every product measured should be processed with the same tool to have common reference.

For this purpose a software tool needs to be developed which charaterises the motor based on the definitions set by the test engineer.

Requirement:

Phase 1: (Torque analysis tool)
I need a measurement tool to be developed to analyse and calculated several parameters of the measurment such as Maximum, Minimum, Average, errors, interesting regions/bands.
These parameters will be defined by the test manager.

Phase 2: (Torque comparison tool)
The tool should provide and option/feature to compare results of several measurements and its results calculated.

Phase 3: (Web application development - Integrating analysis and comparison tool and adding several other features)
Development of Data flow/ data management system to handle the regular measurement data and upgrade to the tool as needed to the test engineers.
